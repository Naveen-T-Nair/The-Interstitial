<p>People often ask me how I balance the technical rigor of a PhD in Power Electronics with the creative, meandering world of reading and writing. To me, they aren't separate worlds at all; they are two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>Both research and reading require a deep-seated curiosity. Both demand patience. Both are, at their core, an act of translation—taking a complex idea and making it understandable, first to yourself, and then to others.</p>
<h2>The Logic of Stories</h2>
<p>In engineering, we follow logical pathways. An electron flows from A to B. A circuit behaves according to predictable, iron-clad laws. But so does a good story. A character's motivation, a plot's progression—these are all built on a framework of cause and effect. A poorly written character feels just as 'wrong' as an equation that doesn't balance.</p>
<blockquote>"The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling, Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven; And as imagination bodies forth The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing A local habitation and a name." - William Shakespeare</blockquote>
<p>This "giving a name to airy nothing" is precisely what we do in research. We are trying to find the shape of an unknown, to give it a name, a model, an equation. My research papers are, in their own way, a form of storytelling. They tell the story of a problem, a hypothesis, a struggle, and (hopefully) a resolution.</p>
