<p>A 5 AM alarm for the gym feels very different from a 5 AM alarm to finish a paper, but the source of the motivation is the same. It's the pursuit of incremental progress.</p>
<p>No one builds a 400-pound deadlift overnight, and no one solves a complex engineering problem in one sitting. Both are games of compounding effort. It's about showing up on the days you don't want to, pushing through the plateau, and trusting the process.</p>
<h2>Embracing the Struggle</h2>
<p>The lab and the gym are two of the few places in modern life where you cannot fake the work. You can't talk your way into a heavier lift, and you can't charm a circuit into working. The results are binary: the weight either moves, or it doesn't. The simulation either runs, or it fails.</p>
<p>This honesty is brutal, but it's also refreshing. It teaches you to respect the process, to be meticulous in your preparation, and to be humble in your approach. The lessons I learn from a failed set in the gym are directly applicable to a failed experiment in the lab: check your setup, analyze what went wrong, rest, and try again.</p>
