<p>We speak of heartbreak as a single, catastrophic event—a 'break.' A shattering. But in engineering, failure is rarely so simple. It is almost always a story. A story of stress, of load, and of fatigue.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a structure fails because it is subjected to a single, acute force it was never designed to withstand. This is a <strong>brittle fracture</strong>. It is sudden, shocking, and total. But more often, failure is a slower, more insidious process. It is a story of <strong>material fatigue</strong>—a tiny, invisible micro-fracture that, under repeated cycles of stress, grows. It propagates quietly, unseen, until the structure's integrity is so compromised that a normal, everyday load causes a catastrophic collapse.</p>
<p>This, to me, feels more like the truth of a human heart. The failure is not the moment it breaks, but the accumulation of tiny, unvoiced stresses that preceded it.</p>

<h2>The Design Flaw</h2>
<p>For weeks, I have been analyzing the failure. As an engineer, it is my nature. I have been running diagnostics, looking for the design flaw. Was the material wrong? Was the initial design naive, too optimistic, blind to the potential loads it would have to bear?</p>
<p>This line of thinking is a trap. It presupposes that the goal is to design a self that is 'unbreakable.' A fortress. But a structure that is perfectly rigid and 'unbreakable' is often the most brittle. It has no give. The moment its limit is reached, it shatters. In engineering, we value 'ductility'—the ability of a material to deform, to bend, to stretch under load *before* it fails. It shows you it's under stress.</p>
<p>This is where engineering and poetry unexpectedly touch. We are not designed to be unbreakable. We are designed to be ductile. The problem is not that we 'break.' The problem is that we don't know what to do with the fracture.</p>

<blockquote>"There is a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in."
<br>— Leonard Cohen</blockquote>

<p>The engineer in me sees a fracture as a failure. The writer in me must learn to see it as an opening. A place where light can enter. A failure, then, is not just an end. It is a data point. It is information. It is, perhaps, an illumination.</p>

<h2>The Work of Rebuilding</h2>
<p>So, we have a failed structure. How do we survive it? How do we rebuild?</p>
<p>I spend a lot of time in the gym. I understand the process of rebuilding muscle. It is not a passive act. You do not heal by *waiting*. You heal by *doing*. When a muscle is torn, the body rebuilds it. And if you apply the right stress—the "work" of a workout—it rebuilds it *stronger*.</p>
<p>This is the active process of 'surviving it.' It is the discipline of showing up. It is the 'reps' of getting out of bed, of doing the research, of reading the book, of going for the run, even when—*especially* when—the load feels too heavy. It is the unglamorous, daily, necessary work of recovery.</p>
<p>Surviving heartbreak isn't about gluing the two broken pieces back together and pretending the crack was never there. It is about rebuilding the entire foundation. It's about finding the other load-bearing walls in your life—your work, your passions, your health, your community—and reinforcing them. You are building *resilience*. You are adding *redundancy*, so that if one part of your life ever fails again, the whole system does not collapse.</p>
<p>The goal is not to return to the person I was before. That structure has been proven to fail. The goal is to build a new one. A self that has integrated the failure, that has learned from the stress. A structure that is not brittle, but resilient. A structure that has cracks, and is all the stronger for them, because it knows, finally, how to let the light in.</p>
